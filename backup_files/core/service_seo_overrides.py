We provide a detailed cost model during discovery that includes migration labor, monthly cloud spend estimates, and projected savings compared to your current on-premises infrastructure."},
            {"q": "Can you help reduce our existing cloud costs?", "a": "Yes. We audit your current cloud environment for idle resources, oversized instances, and unused reservations. Clients typically achieve 20 to 40 percent savings through rightsizing, reserved capacity planning, and automated scaling policies."},
            {"q": "Which cloud platform is best for our business?", "a": "The right platform depends on your workloads and existing tools. Microsoft Azure integrates well with M365 environments, AWS offers the broadest service catalog, and Google Cloud excels at analytics. We evaluate your needs and recommend the best fit."},

We perform sector-level imaging and use specialized tools to extract data from drives with mechanical failures, firmware corruption, or degraded flash storage. Recovery success depends on the extent of physical damage."},
            {"q": "How do you protect sensitive data during recovery?", "a": "Every recovery follows a documented chain-of-custody process. Media is handled in isolated environments, transferred over encrypted channels, and stored on access-controlled systems. We can also sign NDAs and comply with data handling regulations."},
            {"q": "Do you prioritize business-critical files during recovery?", "a": "Yes. We work with you to identify high-priority folders, databases, and application data first. Critical business files are extracted and validated before moving to secondary data, minimizing downtime for essential operations."},
            {"q": "How long does data recovery typically take?", "a": "Simple recoveries from logical failures take 1 to 3 days. Complex mechanical or multi-drive RAID recoveries can take 3 to 10 business days. We provide status updates at each checkpoint and prioritize business-critical files for early handoff when possible."},
            {"q": "Do you recover data from RAID arrays and NAS devices?", "a": "Yes. We support RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10 configurations from Synology, QNAP, Dell EMC, and HPE platforms. Our process includes array reconstruction, volume reassembly, and file-level validation before returning recovered data."},
            {"q": "What is the success rate for data recovery?", "a": "Success depends on failure type and damage severity. Logical failures like accidental deletion or corruption have recovery rates above 90 percent. Mechanical failures vary based on platter and head condition. We provide a diagnostic assessment and probability estimate before starting."},

Whether it is a failing hard drive, cracked screen, or motherboard issue, we diagnose and repair business devices with minimal downtime."},
            {"q": "Can you fix slow computer performance?", "a": "Yes. Slow performance often stems from failing storage, insufficient RAM, thermal throttling, or software conflicts. We run comprehensive diagnostics to identify the root cause and apply targeted fixes — from SSD upgrades to malware removal and OS optimization."},

Every repaired device undergoes a full stress test — CPU load testing, memory validation, thermal monitoring, and application performance checks — before it is returned. This ensures the fix is stable and the device is ready for daily use."},
            {"q": "How long does a typical computer repair take?", "a": "Most repairs are completed same day or within 48 hours. Simple fixes like SSD upgrades and malware removal take 2 to 4 hours. More complex board-level repairs or parts requiring special order may take 3 to 5 business days with status updates at each stage."},
            {"q": "Do you offer onsite computer repair for businesses?", "a": "Yes.

            {"q": "Can you fix HDMI port and display output issues?", "a": "Yes. HDMI port failure is one of the most common console repairs we handle. We use precision micro-soldering to replace damaged connectors and test the full display pipeline — from the GPU output to the HDMI port — to ensure a reliable signal."},
            {"q": "Can console overheating problems be resolved?", "a": "Yes. We disassemble the console, clean the fan and heatsink assembly, replace degraded thermal paste, and verify temperatures under sustained gaming load. This restores proper cooling and prevents thermal shutdowns or performance throttling."},
            {"q": "Do you stress test consoles before returning them?", "a": "Yes. Every repaired console runs through an extended stress test — sustained gaming load, network connectivity checks, controller pairing, and thermal monitoring. We only return the device once it passes all validation benchmarks."},
            {"q": "How much does game console repair cost?", "a": "Pricing depends on the repair type. HDMI port replacements typically cost less than board-level power repairs. We provide a free diagnostic assessment and fixed-price quote before starting any work so there are no surprise charges."},
            {"q": "Do you repair Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck handhelds?", "a": "Yes. We service Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, Steam Deck, and other portable gaming devices. Common repairs include Joy-Con drift fixes, charging port replacement, screen repair, and battery service with full functional testing."},
            {"q": "Can you upgrade my console storage to a larger SSD?", "a": "Yes. We perform SSD upgrades for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and Steam Deck consoles. The upgrade includes drive installation, system restore, and performance validation to ensure faster load times and expanded storage capacity."},

By running comprehensive health checks on devices that appear to work fine, we catch early warning signs — degrading storage, failing memory modules, or thermal issues — before they cause unexpected downtime."},
            {"q": "Do we receive a written diagnostic report?", "a": "Yes. Every diagnostic session produces a clear, prioritized report. It includes hardware health scores, identified risks ranked by business impact, and actionable recommendations for repair, replacement, or upgrade — so you can make informed decisions."},
            {"q": "Can proactive diagnostics actually reduce business downtime?", "a": "Yes. Businesses that schedule regular diagnostic cycles catch hardware failures weeks or months before they impact operations. Early detection allows you to plan replacements during maintenance windows instead of dealing with emergency outages."},
            {"q": "How often should business devices be diagnosed?", "a": "We recommend quarterly diagnostics for mission-critical workstations and biannual checks for standard office devices. High-use environments like healthcare, manufacturing, or finance benefit from monthly cycles to maintain fleet reliability and prevent surprise failures."},
            {"q": "Can you diagnose an entire fleet of devices at once?", "a": "Yes. We run batch diagnostics for device fleets of any size. Remote diagnostic agents collect health data from each endpoint, and we deliver a consolidated fleet report with device-by-device risk scores and prioritized action recommendations."},
            {"q": "What types of devices can you diagnose?", "a": "We diagnose laptops, desktops, servers, tablets, and network infrastructure from all major manufacturers including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung. Both Windows and macOS devices are fully supported in our diagnostic workflow."},
